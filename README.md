# Bike-Sales

## Overview
This project analyzes bike sales data for a fictional retailer in 2025, aiming to uncover insights into sales performance, customer demographics, and product trends. Using a synthetic dataset, the project leverages Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, demonstrating skills in pivot tables, charts, and dashboard creation.

## Dataset
The dataset, bike_sales_dataset.csv, contains 1000 rows and 13 columns, including:

ID, Date, Customer_Age, Gender, Country, State, Product_Category, Sub_Category, Product, Order_Quantity, Unit_Price, Revenue, Profit.
The dataset is clean with no null values, duplicates, or major inconsistencies, simulating a well-structured sales dataset.
Objectives
The goal is to build a comprehensive analysis solution in Excel to provide insights into:

Sales Performance: Revenue and profit trends by region and product category.
Customer Demographics: Age and gender distribution of buyers.
Product Analysis: Top-selling products and categories.
Temporal Trends: Monthly and yearly sales patterns.

## Tools and Technologies
Data Collection : collected the dataset from kaggle.
Excel: Used for data cleaning, analysis (pivot tables, charts), and dashboard creation.

## Key Features
Data Cleaning: Formatted the Date column, ensured numerical columns (Revenue, Profit, Unit_Price) were in currency format, and verified no duplicates or nulls.

## Excel Analysis:
Pivot tables to summarize total revenue by Country, average Customer_Age by Gender, and top products by Order_Quantity.
Charts to visualize revenue by Country (bar chart), monthly revenue trends (line chart), and profit distribution by Product_Category (pie chart).
Slicers for interactive filtering by Gender and Country.
Dashboard: Created an interactive dashboard in Excel with charts, slicers, and KPIs (total revenue, total profit) for a holistic view of sales performance.

## Project Structure
bike_sales_dataset.csv: real time dataset used for analysis.
Data Collection : Gathered the dataset From Kaggle.
bike_sales_analysis.xlsx: Excel file containing the analysis, pivot tables, charts, and dashboard.

## How to Use
Gather Dataset: Gather the  bike_sales_dataset.csv from Kaggle.
Excel Analysis: Open bike_sales_analysis.xlsx in Excel to explore the pivot tables, charts, and dashboard.
Alternatively, import bike_sales_dataset.csv into Excel and follow the analysis steps in the README.
Interact with the Dashboard: Use slicers to filter by Gender and Country, and view key insights via charts and KPIs.

## Future Improvements
Introduce real-world data issues (e.g., nulls, duplicates) to practice advanced data cleaning.
Add more advanced Excel features like Power Query for data transformation.
Incorporate forecasting models to predict future sales trends.
